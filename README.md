# CS182_Final_Project



##  Project Goal & Dataset

This project aims to explore **two clustering methods** — **K-means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** — and compare their performance on different dimensionality-reduced versions of the dataset.

We apply **unsupervised learning techniques** to identify car models that are **direct competitors to Volkswagen** vehicles. Specifically, we seek models that:

- Belong to the **same cluster** as Volkswagen cars, and  
- Have prices within a **±10% range** compared to Volkswagen models.

The dataset consists of **205 car models** with **26 features**, including both **technical specifications** and **categorical attributes**, such as:

- Fuel type, drive wheel, engine type, horsepower, number of doors, and more.


## Usage
### Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run data preprocessing
To run **Data_Preprocess.ipynb**, please launch jupyter notebook first:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Run dimensionality reduction
Run dimensionality reduction in **Dimensional_Reduction.ipynb**

### Run clustering
Run clustering in **Clustering.ipynb**

## Result
Once you have completed the four steps above, the output plots generated by K-means and Hierarchical Clustering on PCA, AutoEncoder (AE), and Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE) -reduced data will be available in their respective folders: `PCA`, `AE`, and `SAE`. For more details, please refer to `.pdf`
